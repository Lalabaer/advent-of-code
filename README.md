### How to run

Replace X with the day you want to get results for and run the following command on your terminal:

```console
foo@bar:~$ php 2024/src/DayX/DayX.php
```

If you want to test the script using your personal input data

-   Put your personal input data in a new textfile e.g. input_data.txt, saved in the day folder
-   Pass the path to the file on terminal like:

```console
foo@bar:~$ php 2024/src/DayX/DayX.php input_data.txt
```
